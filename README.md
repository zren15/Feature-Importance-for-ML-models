# The five methods to Estimate Feature Importance for ML models
The feature importance describes which features are relevant. It can help with a better understanding of the solved problem and sometimes lead to model improvement by utilizing feature selection. In this repo, I will present 5 ways (with code) to compute feature importance for the Random Forest algorithm in Python.
